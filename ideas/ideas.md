### Conceptual contemplations ###

** Learning goals **
I want to learn to measure memory and CPU demands / efficiency, and to enumerate it.
I want to learn to reason about the ideal data structure for the task (be it a bit field, a graph, etc.),
and gain conceptual clarity as of what kinds of mathematical / computational structures am I using and why.

I'd like to explore different angles of conceiving and solving the dead-alive pattern-matching problem.
Exploring different fields of mathematics and gaining at least a glimpse of their relatedness.
Could abstract algebras be of relevance here? Grammars? Geometric algebra?
Could some statistical mechanics principles be discovered / illustrated here?

** Data structure **
I'm contemplating the ideal data structure for the dead / alive filtering / pattern matching.
With the Vector of cells, I'm using a one dimensional structure, right?
This could be seen as a specific, narrow kind of a graph though, couldn't it?
What if I used a real graph and existing graph algorithms?
